# Gamesys-Challenge
48 Hour Gamesys Challenge

Note
- if you win, it only updates UI for the current money after you try and bet again
- The buttons only work if you press the top middle of them (and appear to not be very responsive in Firefox)

(There was meant to be a bunch of random sprites for the racers but didn't get chance to write the loader)

p.s the game name came from one of the randomly generated names (there is a gif for it but didn't get chance to write gif specific loader)
