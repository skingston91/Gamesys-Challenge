# Gamesys-Challenge
48 Hour Gamesys Challenge

Note
- if you win, it only updates UI for the current money after you try and bet again
- The buttons appear to not be very responsive in Firefox, works correctly in Chrome and IE

Two Libaries were used:
- KineticJS for UI button input and drawing (I regret using this - should have coded myself)
- Soundmanager2 for sound

(There was meant to be a bunch of random sprites for the racers but didn't get chance to write the loader)

p.s The game name came from one of the randomly generated names (there is a gif for a Burrito racer instead but didn't get chance to write gif animation specific loader so unused)
